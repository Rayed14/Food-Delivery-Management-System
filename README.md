# SDA-Project
My final SDA project with full backend as well as frontend interface. 

This project is a food delivery management system, that was made for a univeristy course project SDA(Software Design and Analysis).

The project is ditributed in different packages. 
Application package holds all the frontend files.
Database package holds all the backend files.
Busniess Logic includes all the functionality.

Application Package:
  This package is divided into fxml files and java class files that are the controller of those specific file.
  The rest are images which are used in the project. 
  
 Database Package:
  This package includes the databse connecter file, the database used for this project was MySQL Workbench.
  
 Busniess Logic:
  All the implementation is in this package.
  
 *HOW TO RUN:
      -Firstly make a new java project and save the folders application, business logic and DB to the src folder of that project.
      -Next navigate to the application package
      -Open the application package and navigate to the main file
      -Run the main file from there
